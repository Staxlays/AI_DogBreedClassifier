This is my Capstone project for my Computer Science Bachelor's
I wanted to create an AI program that can take classify a dog's breed from a submitted image. I utilized the open source Stanford Dogs dataset to train a resnet50 AI on the various dog breeds over 15 epochs.
There is a full report on the project proposal and accuracy in the Project_Report.pdf file!
